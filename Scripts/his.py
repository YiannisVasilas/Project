# # Step 1: values in vmin and vmax were set to âˆ’100 and 100 mmol/g DW h for reversible reactions
# 1.1 Find reversible reactions
# 1.2 Change reversible reactions allowable fluxes to -100 to 100
# # Step 2: Figure out which are the media components essential for cell growth
# 2.1 change boundary condition of compounds where there are measured rates available to those rates
# 2.2 change boundary conditions to -100 and 100

# which carbon and nitrogen sources are allowing growth? from the paper
## Model
# evaluate in silico carbon and nitrogen sources (from the paper)
# add reactions of the mevalonate pathway (email from Frank)

# are there genes in the model which are not in the industrial strain?
# if they are isozymes, then deleting would not change anything?

## Annotation
# how many genes do they have in comon? -> venn diagramm

## eLabNotebook

# write more emails/ ask if I am stuck
# send a short email of how I am doing with the model after the exam
