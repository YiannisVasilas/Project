'''Documentation with Maria Talk'''
# which carbon and nitrogen sources are allowing growth? from the paper
## Model
# evaluate in silico carbon and nitrogen sources (from the paper)
# add reactions of the mevalonate pathway (email from Frank)

# are there genes in the model which are not in the industrial strain?
# if they are isozymes, then deleting would not change anything?

## Annotation
# how many genes do they have in comon? -> venn diagramm

## eLabNotebook

# write more emails/ ask if I am stuck
# send a short email of how I am doing with the model after the exam
